# Information about Swift
Swift is a general purpose,multi paradigm compiled programming language created by Apple Inc 
mainly to be used as a language for the software used in their Operating Systems for their devices,
	
	1. Swift is based on Objective-C runtime library so that it can easily work with
	C,Objective C,C++  and itself within one program
	2. It was designed by Chris Lattner, Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, Joe Groff who were a part 
	of Apples team.  
	3. It can be considered  a young language because it first appeared in 2014, and Apple didn't make it
	open-source until 2015.
	4. Alhough it was mainly designed to be used for iOS application development it has recently became popular
	as a scripting language for website development.
	

# Sample Swift Syntax
	
	
	var My_var=4 
	var my_float: Double = 4
	print(my_float)  // => 4.0
	let My_constant = 90
	
# TOOLS you need for swift,

	1.Swift uses the open-source LLVM compiler framework
	2. You might want to use Xcode, Apples IDE if you wish to run Swift programs
	   on iOS devices 
	3. A Mac or Linux device is recommended for programming Swift
	4. If you wish to use it on a Linux device, it is best to use Atom text editor
	   and the communtiy sourced swift IDE package.
				
# The Swift standard library 
  Swift has quite an extensive libray, below we have highlighted some of the common data structures
  in Swift. It also has other protocols and generator functions present in its library, some of whose
  implementation you can find in the standard libray file of this repository.

	It lets you use the standard data stuctures such as Arrays, Lists and Hashmaps
	For Example:
	var My_List=[5, 6, 7,8]
	var My_Hashmap: [String:String] = ["Jordan":"Basketball Player", "Alex" :"Astrologist"];
	
	
		
# Popular Open Source Contributions
  Since Swift is a relatively young language, there aren't that many open source libraies around. We 
  have highlighted a couple of the popular contributions abvilable in the growing swift open source
  community. 
		 
	 1. Vapor, An open source library for Web Development and Server side handling 
		Docs available at: https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/
	 2. Kingfisher, An open source library for Image processing from web urls for 
		swift applications. 
		Docs available at: https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher
	 3. SwiftyJson, A library that runs on top the swift built in json parser
		to make it easier to parse JSON files. Since Swift requires explicit
		typing, it might make it difficult to read JSON files from different 
		sources. SwiftyJSON helps bridge that gap.
		Docs available at: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON
