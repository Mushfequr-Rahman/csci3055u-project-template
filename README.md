# Information about Swift
Swift is a general purpose,multi paradigm compiled programming language created by Apple Inc 
mainly to be used as a language for the software used in their Operating Systems for their devices,
	
	1. Swift is based on Objective-C runtime library so that it can easily work with
	C,Objective C,C++  and itself within one program
	2. 

# Sample Swift Syntax
	
	
	var My_var=4 
	var my_float: Double = 4
	print(my_float)  // => 4.0
	let My_constant = 90
	
# TOOLS you need for swift,

	1.Swift uses the open-source LLVM compiler framework
	2. You might want to use Xcode, Apples IDE if you wish to run Swift programs
			on iOS devices 
	3. A Mac or Linux device is recommended for programming Swift
	4. If you wish to use it on a Linux device, it is best to use Atom text editor
			and the communtiy sourced swift IDE package.
				
# The Swift standard library 
		

	It lets you use the standard data stuctures such as Arrays, Lists and Hashmaps
	For Example:
	var My_List=[5, 6, 7,8]
	var My_Hashmap: [String:String] = ["Jordan":"Basketball Player", "Alex" :"Astrologist"];
