in structure to C++ code, it is also vastly different in syntax notation and 
makes it much easier for the programmer

//If we had used C++, we are  required to include the return type as well before the function
//But in swift creating a function is as simple as calling the keyword func before the name and assigning an 
//arrow to sefine the return type.
