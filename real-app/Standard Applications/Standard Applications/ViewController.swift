 This is the section of the Package that deals with handling.
 Here we will be tryng to design an iOS application that will
 try simply play music from the phone's library when the button
 is pressed. Although the application's scope isnt that broad,
 we can see the implementation of several of swift basic concepts such as calling functions and variable declaration and how
 the var is able to dynamically bind ta query of the Media player.
 
 The visual aspects of this program can be seen in the Main.storyboard() section of the package. The ViewController.swift is responsible for dealing with
